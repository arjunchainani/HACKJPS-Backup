We have two focuses today the first is to learn what rhetoric is and the second is to familiarize you with the rhetorical situation. So first let's look at a brief illustration of rhetoric. After the assassination of Martin Luther King jr there was rioting in over a hundred cities in the U.S. Two major cities were not among them. One was Memphis, Tennessee, where Martin Luther King Jr had spoken one day before his assassination on April 3rd, 1968. The other was Indianapolis, Indiana, where Robert Kennedy spoke on April 4th, 1968. Upon hearing the news of King's assassination, writer Tim Wendell said, to this day, many people believe that was due to the words spoken when so many were listening. This is an illustration of the power of words, or rhetoric. So what is rhetoric? It's the study of effective persuasive language use. In other words, it's the power of words. Understanding rhetoric enables you to understand and participate better in conversations about important issues in the world. It gives you a voice, and the skills transfer to college and well beyond. So the first step to understanding rhetoric and using it ourselves is to analyze how other writers use it. There are components you see on the screen here. So one is exigence. It's what prompted the message to be spoken or written in the first place. One is purpose. Why the speaker is conveying a message. Audience. Who the speaker is speaking to. The context, or circumstances surrounding the situation. The writer is who is doing the writing, and then the message is what the writer wants the audience to think or to know.
