Apple recently released a new app called Apple music classical and it's caused some confusion with people wondering why Apple made a separate app if it costs extra and how managing to music apps even works well the classical app is free for Apple music subscribers and it was created to solve problems that are unique to the classical music genre you see modern songs have fairly short titles while classical Works have detailed titles to describe several aspects of the song like the composition type for example Symphony partita or in this case Sonata the number represents the 14th Sonata written by that composer then there's the key signature and any featured instruments this naming structure is not only completely different from modern music it's also highly variable this tile is considered generic there can also be non-generic titles for the same song as well as non-numeric titles so you can imagine how complicated it might be to search for a piece that goes by several different names and to complicate things even further that piece was likely recorded by hundreds of different artists something that doesn't happen with modern music so searching for a specific classical piece and apple music would be quite clumsy which is why Apple purchase a third-party app called Prime and used it to develop their own classical app which allows users to search for particular work composer-conductor or catalog number and View and neatly organized profile highlighting all available recordings by various artists a detailed description of the peace and related Works breast searching for the same thing in the Apple music app would provide an unorganized list of results that's frustrating to navigate but what about different music libraries in two different apps in the library and no matter which app
