# JPS-HACKS-Notes-App

## The Plan
A notes app for deaf people
You can insert a lecture that is transcripted and then translated into sign language
Oh yeah this is actually a pretty good idea. I think it might be doable with a text-to-speech library or smth (Python: Convert Speech to text and text to Speech - GeeksforGeeks) 
Subtitles
We can use a large language model to take in the lecture speech and make it more concise for the notes (then we can go in ML category too)

Pros:
- Similar to number 3 pros
- People who make captions have easier lives
- Cooler YouTube captions

Cons:
- Hard to make (maybe)
- Challenge
